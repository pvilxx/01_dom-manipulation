### **Exercise Completion (1-5)** ‚Üí üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **10%**

Evaluate the correctness and functionality of each DOM manipulation task.

| **Score** | **Criteria**                                                                              |

| **3**     | Some exercises are completed correctly, but others are incorrect or incomplete.           |
| **4**     | Most exercises are completed correctly, but there are small issues in some tasks.         |
| **5**     | All exercises are implemented correctly, meeting the expected functionality.              |

### **Code Quality (1-5)** ‚Üí üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **20%**

Evaluate the structure, readability, and cleanliness of the code.

| **Score** | **Criteria**                                                                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **2**     | Code is somewhat organized but has several issues (e.g., inconsistent indentation, unclear logic).      |
| **3**     | Code is functional but could use improvements in clarity and structure. Comments are missing or sparse. |
| **4**     | Code is clean and readable, with proper indentation, variable naming, and some comments.                |
| **5**     | Code is well-organized, easy to follow, and includes appropriate comments explaining key parts.         |

### **DOM Manipulation Techniques (1-5)** ‚Üí üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **40%**

Evaluate the use of appropriate DOM manipulation methods and techniques.

| **Score** | **Criteria**                                                                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **2**     | Some DOM methods are used, but there are issues with syntax or choice of methods.           |
| **3**     | Most DOM methods are used appropriately, though some could be optimized or corrected.       |
| **4**     | DOM methods are used correctly and effectively for most tasks.                              |
| **5**     | All DOM manipulation tasks are handled efficiently and correctly using appropriate methods. |

### **Handling Events (1-5)** ‚Üí üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **20%**

Evaluate the handling of events like clicks and input changes.

| **Score** | **Criteria**                                                                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **2**     | Event listeners are present, but do not function as intended or are incomplete.       |
| **3**     | Basic event handling is implemented but may have small errors or be limited in scope. |
| **4**     | Event handling is implemented correctly with minor issues or inefficiencies.          |
| **5**     | Event handling is implemented flawlessly, responding correctly and efficiently.       |
